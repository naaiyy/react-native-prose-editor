# Changelog

## [0.5.16] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- iOS and Android keyboard suggestions and autocorrections now commit into the Rust-backed editor state instead of being immediately reverted by reconciliation.

## [0.5.15] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `NativeRichTextEditor` now exposes `autoCapitalize`, `autoCorrect`, and `keyboardType` props on iOS and Android.

### Fixed

- Standalone `EditorToolbar` instances now render mention suggestions while the editor's built-in toolbar is hidden.
- Standalone mention suggestion chips now apply mention addon popover styles and per-suggestion `resolveTheme` overrides.
- iOS focus restoration calls now explicitly discard `becomeFirstResponder()` return values, removing Swift unused-result warnings.

## [0.5.14] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Hardened Android consumer ProGuard rules and JNA dependency metadata so minified apps keep the UniFFI/JNA runtime classes, including `com.sun.jna.Native`.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Android release builds with R8 minification now include package consumer ProGuard rules for the UniFFI/JNA bridge, fixing missing `java.awt.Component` failures from JNA desktop-only references.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Android standalone toolbar taps no longer dismiss the keyboard before the first editor newline has been entered.
- Android backspace now continues correctly after breaking an empty trailing item out of a multi-item list.
- Backspacing over list marker prefixes now joins previous list items or unwraps the first item instead of leaving the cursor stuck.
- Empty-block placeholder backspace handling now sends the caret scalar on Android and tolerates the pre-placeholder scalar path in the Rust core.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- `NativeRichTextEditorRef.getCaretRect()` returns the current caret rectangle and editor dimensions in editor-local coordinates on iOS and Android.
- Standalone `EditorToolbar` instances now preserve editor focus by default via measured toolbar hit-test frames, with `preserveEditorFocus={false}` available for embedded toolbar cases.

### Fixed

- Standalone toolbar taps no longer blur the editor or dismiss and immediately re-show the keyboard on Android and iOS.
- Android standalone toolbar hit testing now handles multiple toolbar frames and Android coordinate-space differences between React Native `measureInWindow` and native raw touch events.
- Android focus-preservation state now starts inactive and is cleared on real blur so outside taps can still dismiss the keyboard.
- Android no longer mutates the keyboard toolbar view hierarchy from inside `WindowInsets` dispatch, avoiding a framework `dispatchApplyWindowInsets` null-reference crash.
- Android native toolbar active-button color resolution now uses the AppCompat `colorPrimary` attribute fallback, avoiding a Material `R.attr.colorPrimary` `NoSuchFieldError`.
- Added regression coverage for caret geometry, standalone toolbar frame serialization, Android toolbar hit testing, and toolbar focus-preservation state.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Android CRDT editing now keeps Samsung Keyboard and other IME composing text transient until commit, then applies the final text at the original Rust-authorised range.
- iOS marked-text composition now uses the same original-range commit path, preventing transient `UITextView` composition state from shifting CRDT insertion or replacement offsets.
- Added Android and iOS regression coverage for composition commits, selection replacement, transient deletes, and reconciliation suppression during composing text.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- iOS no longer crashes under `KeyboardProvider` when the editor is wrapped by `react-native-keyboard-controller`.
- Android now respects `theme.backgroundColor: "transparent"` instead of falling back to a white editor background.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- `EditorTheme.placeholderColor` for customising the placeholder text color.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- `NativeProseViewer.contentId` and `NativeProseViewer.containerWidth` props for height pre-measurement, removing the brief zero-height flash on mount in `FlatList`.
- `clearHeightCache()` export to free cached viewer heights.
- `EditorLinkTheme` interface and `EditorTheme.links` for styling link text.
- `MentionsAddonConfig.resolveTheme` callback for per-mention theme overrides at insertion time. The resolved theme is stored as a `mentionTheme` attribute on the mention node.
- Rust render engine now includes `mentionTheme` on `OpaqueInlineAtom` elements and applies `mentionSuggestionChar` trigger prefixes to mention labels.

### Fixed

- Mention insertion in `NativeRichTextEditor` now resolves per-mention theme via `resolveTheme` before writing attributes.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- Updated Android JNA to `5.18.1` so bundled native JNA libraries support 16 KB page-size Android devices required by Google Play.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- `NativeProseViewer` no longer emits height before the native text view has been laid out, fixing inflated heights for long messages in list contexts on both iOS and Android.
- `NativeProseViewer` now converts Android pixel heights to density-independent points, matching `NativeRichTextEditor` behaviour.
- `NativeProseViewer` on Android no longer shows spellcheck underlines on rendered text.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- `NativeProseViewer` now collapses to zero height when `collapseTrailingEmptyParagraphs` is enabled and the rendered document contains only empty paragraphs.
- `NativeProseViewer` now accepts later corrected height measurements so very long messages do not keep stale extra bottom spacing.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- `NativeProseViewer.collapseTrailingEmptyParagraphs` to trim trailing empty paragraph blocks in viewer output, enabled by default.
- `NativeProseViewer` link taps are now enabled by default, with `onPressLink` available to intercept taps and run custom actions instead of the native default open behaviour.
- `NativeProseViewer.contentHTML` for rendering read-only HTML input directly.
- `EditorTheme.list.baseIndentMultiplier` to control the starting list indent level independently from the per-level `indent` step.
- `EditorTheme.toolbar.marginTop` and `EditorTheme.toolbar.showTopBorder` to tune the inline toolbar spacing and top separator.

### Changed

- `NativeProseViewer.contentRevision` replaces the JSON-specific `contentJSONRevision` prop name.
- Mention suggestions now render inside the JS inline toolbar path when `NativeRichTextEditor.toolbarPlacement` is set to `"inline"`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- `NativeRichTextEditor.autoDetectLinks` for opt-in automatic URL detection.
- Mentions addon `resolveSelectionAttrs` to merge custom attrs into mention nodes.
- `NativeProseViewer` mention rendering hooks for prefix insertion and per-mention theme overrides.

### Fixed

- Mention insertions now preserve `mentionSuggestionChar` in node attrs for parity with Tiptap-style mention payloads.
- `NativeProseViewer` auto-height is more stable for long content in delayed-layout contexts and ignores stale late shrink measurements.
- iOS now removes the leftover leading text gutter when `contentInsets` are explicitly set to zero.
- iOS list bullets and ordered markers no longer inherit bold sizing or weight from the first inline run in a list item.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `NativeProseViewer` mention rendering hooks for viewer-side prefix insertion and per-mention theme overrides.

### Fixed

- Moved prettier to dev dependencies.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- `NativeProseViewer` for rendering static ProseMirror/Prose JSON without creating a full editable editor instance.
- Tappable mention support in the viewer via `onPressMention`.
- Native `renderDocumentJson` bridge support for turning document JSON into render elements without mounting an editor surface.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- iOS now restores sentence-start auto-capitalization when focus lands in a fully empty editor.
- `insertContentHtml()` and `insertContentJson()` now resolve mixed block fragments such as paragraph-plus-list content at the block level instead of trying to nest block nodes inside the current paragraph, preventing `paragraph has unexpected child 'paragraph'` transform errors.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Whole-document JSON entry points now normalize `{ type: 'doc', content: [] }` to a schema-valid empty document before passing content into the Rust core. This covers `initialJSON`, controlled `valueJSON`, and imperative `setContentJson()` or bridge-level JSON replacement calls, preventing `doc requires at least 1 child` transform errors with schemas that require block content.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Collaboration disconnect and destroy flows now clear and broadcast removal of the local awareness session so remote peers do not keep stale duplicate cursors after unmounts or reconnects.
- Collaboration state now preserves legitimately empty shared documents. The schema-aware empty-document fallback is bootstrap-only and is no longer reported back as durable shared content.
- Android placeholders now follow the effective paragraph text style and auto-grow height accounts for wrapped placeholder lines while the editor is empty.

### Performance

- iOS now applies localised render-block patches and faster attributed-text mutations for many in-place edits.
- iOS position conversion now uses cached UTF-16/scalar lookup tables with incremental patch updates.
- iOS auto-grow layout and remote-selection rendering now do less redundant work by caching measured content height, coalescing overlay refreshes, and skipping unchanged native prop payloads for theme, addons, toolbar, and remote selections.
- Android now skips full native render rebuilds for no-op updates when the resolved render blocks and visual styling are unchanged.
- Collaboration now avoids rebroadcasting identical local selection and focus awareness payloads.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Heading support with `h1` through `h6` schema nodes in both `tiptapSchema` and `prosemirrorSchema` presets.
- `group` toolbar item type for collapsing multiple buttons behind one slot, with `'expand'` and `'menu'` presentation modes.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Block image node with native resize handles on iOS and Android.
- `onRequestImage`, `insertImage(src, attrs?)`, `ImageRequestContext`, `allowBase64Images`, `allowImageResizing`.
- `imageNodeSpec`, `withImagesSchema`, `buildImageFragmentJson` schema helpers.
- `onHistoryStateChange` callback for standalone toolbar undo/redo state.
- `attrs` field on `RenderElement`.

### Fixed

- iOS native toolbar disabled buttons invisible on dark blur backgrounds.

### Changed

- Default toolbar icon set now includes `image`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Real-time collaboration support via `useYjsCollaboration` hook and `createYjsCollaborationController` factory.
- Collaboration types: `YjsCollaborationOptions`, `YjsCollaborationState`, `YjsTransportStatus`, `LocalAwarenessUser`, `LocalAwarenessState`, `CollaborationPeer`, `EncodedCollaborationStateInput`.
- Remote selection decorations for rendering other users' cursors and selections as native overlays.
- Blockquote support: `toggleBlockquote()` ref method and default toolbar item.
- Link toolbar item type with `onRequestLink` callback and `LinkRequestContext` for host-driven URL entry.
- `markAttrs` field on `ActiveState` exposing active mark attributes (e.g. link `href`).
- `EditorLayoutManager` on iOS for custom glyph and list marker rendering.
- `PositionBridge` on iOS for UTF-16 to Unicode scalar offset conversion.
- `RemoteSelectionOverlayView` on Android for rendering remote user selections.
- Native collaboration session management in the bridge layer (create, destroy, encode/decode state).
- `encodeCollaborationStateBase64` and `decodeCollaborationStateBase64` utility functions.
- `buildMentionFragmentJson` helper for programmatic mention insertion.
- Collaboration guide with full API reference documentation.
- Documentation for `RemoteSelectionDecoration`, `EditorAddonEvent`, and mention schema helpers.

### Changed

- Default `heightBehavior` is now `'autoGrow'` instead of `'fixed'`.
- Android toolbar updated with blockquote and link icon mappings and Material Design color support.
- iOS native module now exposes `editorSetMark`, `editorUnsetMark`, and `editorToggleBlockquote`.
- Example app restructured with collaboration panel and updated demo components.
